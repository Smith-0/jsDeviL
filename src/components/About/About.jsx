                My name is Sahil Ghangash, a self-taught full stack developer
                with over three years of experience in the web development
                field. My journey began during my second year of college when I
                co-founded a startup with a friend. We needed a functional
                website to launch, which led me to dive into web development,
                starting with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with PHP
                for backend work. From there, I found my passion for development
                and never looked back.

                Currently, I specialize in the MERN stack and have been working
                at Apwrk Solutions for the past two years, where Iâ€™ve had the
                opportunity to contribute to{" "}
                <strong>four Unilever projects</strong>. Among these, I played a
                key role in <strong>Mesha</strong>, a finance management
                application, where I focused primarily on the UI, utilizing{" "}
                <strong>Next.js</strong>. Additionally, I contributed to:

                <li>

                In addition to my work at Appwrk IT Solutions, I provide
